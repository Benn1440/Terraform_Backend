# Terraform State File

Terraform state files are critical for managing the infrastructure resources that Terraform provisions. Hereâ€™s an overview of what they are, how they work, and best practices for managing them.

What Are Terraform State Files?
Terraform state files (terraform.tfstate) keep track of the infrastructure resources managed by Terraform. They store information about:

* Resources that have been created.
* Metadata and mapping between Terraform configuration and real-world resources.
* Resource dependencies.

# Why Are They Important?
* Consistency: They ensure Terraform operations like plan, apply, and destroy are consistent and accurate.
* Tracking: They track the current state of infrastructure, enabling Terraform to know what exists and what needs to change.
* Performance: They improve performance by caching data about resources.
